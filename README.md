This study utilizes a diverse dataset across four categories: emails, SMS, URLs, and website data. The email dataset includes over 18,000 emails. The SMS dataset comprises 5,971 messages, converted from images to text, and includes spam, phishing, and regular messages. The URL dataset contains over 800,000 URLs, with 52% legitimate and 47% phishing domains, sourced from JPCERT, Kaggle, GitHub, and other open databases. The website dataset consists of 80,000 instances, split into 50,000 legitimate and 30,000 phishing sites, each with a URL and its HTML page.：PHISHINGDEFENSE
