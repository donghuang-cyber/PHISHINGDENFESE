PHISHINGDEFENSE

Overview

It is a comprehensive pipeline designed for detecting multiple phishing attacks. This project integrates advanced techniques, including fine-tuning pre-trained models and incorporating adversarial training, to enhance phishing detection across various types of phishing attempts.

The project will be open-sourced soon, providing access to its code, data, model weights, and other related content.

Features

- **Robust Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art methods to identify phishing attacks in emails, SMS, URLs, and more.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Combines fine-tuning of pre-trained models with adversarial training to improve detection accuracy and resilience.
- **Comprehensive Pipeline**: Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction components.

Contents

1. Data

- **Dataset**: The dataset includes a variety of phishing data, such as emails, SMS, and URLs. It is used for training and evaluating the detection models.
- **Format**: Data is provided in CSV and JSON formats, ensuring compatibility with common data processing tools.

2. Code

- **Preprocessing**: Scripts for data cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- **Model Training**: Code for training the detection models, including fine-tuning and adversarial training procedures.
- **Evaluation**: Scripts for evaluating model performance and generating metrics.
- **Prediction**: Code for using the trained models to make predictions on new data.

3. Model Weights

- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes weights for models that have been fine-tuned on phishing datasets.
- **Usage**: Instructions on how to load and use the model weights in your own projects.

4. Future Plans

We plan to open-source PHISHINGDEFENSE soon. The project will be made available with detailed documentation on how to use and extend it. This will include:

- **Detailed Instructions**: Comprehensive guides on setting up and running the pipeline.
- **Extensive Documentation**: In-depth explanations of the model architecture, training processes, and evaluation methods.
- **Community Support**: We will provide support for issues and encourage contributions from the community to further enhance the project.
