Overview
PHISHINGDEFENSE is a comprehensive pipeline designed for detecting multiple phishing attacks across different data types, including emails, SMS, URLs, and websites. The project provides robust phishing detection using advanced machine learning techniques, ensuring a multi-faceted defense mechanism for various attack vectors. The project will be open-sourced soon, providing access to its code, pre-trained models, dataset, and other essential components.

Features
Robust Detection: Implements various state-of-the-art techniques for identifying phishing threats in different formats.
Advanced Techniques: Utilizes machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and adversarial training to improve detection accuracy.
Comprehensive Pipeline: Covers the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Contents
1. Data
The dataset used in this study is a comprehensive collection across four categories: emails, SMS, URLs, and websites.

Email Dataset: Contains over 18,000 emails labeled as either legitimate or phishing. The data comes from various sources and covers different types of phishing attempts.
SMS Dataset: Includes 5,971 messages, originally extracted from images and converted to text. It contains different categories such as spam, phishing, and regular messages.
URL Dataset: Comprises over 800,000 URLs, with 52% legitimate and 47% phishing domains. The dataset is sourced from trusted open databases like JPCERT, Kaggle, GitHub, and others.
Website Dataset: Contains 80,000 instances with 50,000 legitimate and 30,000 phishing websites. Each instance includes a URL and its corresponding HTML page for analysis.
Format: The datasets are provided in CSV and JSON formats for easy compatibility with popular data processing tools.

2. Code
The repository includes various scripts and functions, such as:

Preprocessing: Scripts to clean, tokenize, and prepare the data for model training.
Model Training: Code for training various machine learning and deep learning models to detect phishing attacks.
Evaluation: Scripts for testing model performance and calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Code to run predictions on new, unseen data, and make phishing attack predictions.
3. Model Weights
Pre-trained Models: Once the project is open-sourced, it will include pre-trained models for phishing detection, which can be fine-tuned or used as-is for your own applications.
Usage: Instructions on how to load and use the pre-trained models for prediction and further experimentation.
4. Future Plans
We are planning to release PHISHINGDEFENSE as an open-source project in the near future. This will include:

Detailed Instruction: A comprehensive guide on how to use the pipeline, train models, and make predictions.
Extensive Documentation: Full documentation covering the project setup, configuration, and customization options.
Community Support: As the project grows, we will foster a community to help improve the pipeline, contribute to development, and provide user support.
Getting Started
To get started with PHISHINGDEFENSE once the repository is available:
